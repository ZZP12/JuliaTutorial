# FBA/FVA model
the cell uptakes m_A_e
[] catalyzes the reversible conversion of m_A_c into m_B_c
[] catalyzes the conversion of m_A_c into m_C_c
[] catalyzes the conversion of m_C_c into m_B_c
the cell secretes m_B_c
the cell secretes m_C_c

m_, p_, mRNA_, g_ are METABOLITE, PROTEIN, MRNA, GENE
_e, _c are _exc, _c
